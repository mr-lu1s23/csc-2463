        <h1>Survival Run</h1>
        <p>
            You play as a guy who has one goal: run past as many obstacles as possible.
            You have three lives and hitting a rock or a tree will result in losing
            a life. To prevent losing a life, you have to jump over rocks and attack
            trees.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the Arduino controller, the three lights on the controller represent
            the number of lives the player has.
        </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Future Development</h2>
        <p>
            Future improvements to this game would involve more obstacles, pickups, 
            a double jump, and different levels.
